An interactive hour-by-hour exploration of the Twitter landscape on the day of the 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. For each hour, the yellow visualization shows the network structure of the top five accounts of that hour (nodes are accounts, edges are mentions or retweets). Displays randomized tweets from that hour along with the top five words, extracted using text analysis on tweet bodies. Can you see changes in the network structure throughout the day as violence escalates?

Thanks to the MIT Media Labâ€™s Center for Constructive Communication for the dataset.
